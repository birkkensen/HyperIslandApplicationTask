        <h3>Application Task</h3>
        <h1>Out with the Old School</h1>
        <p>Today we’re pushing elementary students (first - ninth grade)
          to
          do up to eight hours of school and then pile them with homework for an additional one to three hours at
          home.
          No wonder that children today suffer from anxiety, depression, and sleep deprivation.</p>

            <p class="py-1"><span class="f-letter">W</span> ith the long hours
              at
              school and home, many students lose their study motivation and/or have to give up hobbies such as sports
              and
              music. Imagine doing a full day at the office only to do another four or so hours of office work at home,
              Monday through Friday, and most of the weekends. How long would you hold?</p>


            <p class="py-1">This problem could be resolved by removing homework for children in elementary school. It’s
              an implementation that would benefit teachers
              as well as students. </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                It is said that Einstein came up with the relativity theory while biking and that Charles
                Darwin
                came up with most of the science of evolution while taking long walks.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <br>

            <p class="py-1">
              Having to correct and follow up on every single student takes a massive amount of
              time,
              it would eliminate a lot of overtime. An elementary teacher works on average 45 hours a week if not
              including
              breaks. Eight out of ten do an additional one to five hours on the weekend with pre-and post-work. By
              removing
              homework the teachers would be able to focus their time and energy on planning effective curriculums and
              meaningful lessons. Homework also creates a learning gap between children. The variation of different
              parents'
              ability to help their children with their assignments is vast. The parents’ access to time, energy, money,
              and
              education is a question of equality that directly affects students and their study results.</p>

            <p class="py-1">It is said that Einstein came up with the relativity theory while biking and that Charles
              Darwin
              came up with most of the science of evolution while taking long walks. By removing time-consuming home
              studies, children would have access to more free time to perform creativity-boosting activities such as
              sports. It has been proven that creativity comes to us when we’re physically active. Studies show that
              students
              performed sixty percent better during brainstorming, and remembered on average twenty percent more at
              vocable
              tests after taking walks around campus beforehand.</p>

            <p class="py-1">Therefore, removing homework will benefit students immensely and improve their results as
              well
              as their creativity. Inequality between families who can and cannot help their children at home will no
              longer
              be an issue. Having more free time to participate in sports and activities will lead to reduced stress and
              anxiety, boosting creativity and improving general well-being. Benefitting not only students but teachers
              as
              well. By having more study free time, I believe it will increase students’ curiosity during class.
              Education
              will therefore have a feeling of purpose and meaning, instead of a necessary evil. By removing the old
              school,
              kids will no longer be too cool for school.
