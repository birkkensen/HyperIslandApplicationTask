        <p class="py-1"><span class="f-letter">T</span>oday we’re pushing elementary students (first - ninth grade) to
          do up to eight hours of school and then pile them with homework for an additional one to three hours at home.
          No wonder that children today suffer from anxiety, depression, and sleep deprivation? With the long hours at
          school and home, many students lose their study motivation and/or have to give up hobbies such as sports and
          music. Imagine doing a full day at the office only to do another four or so hours of office work at home,
          Monday through Friday, and most of the weekends. How long would you hold?</p>

        <p class="py-1">This problem could be resolved by removing homework for children in elementary school and have
          teacher-led study groups for everyone who needs it. It’s an implementation that would benefit the teachers as
          well as the students. Having to correct and follow up on every single student takes a massive amount of time,
          it would eliminate a lot of overtime. An elementary teacher works on average 45 hours a week if not including
          breaks. Eight out of ten do an additional one to five hours on the weekend with pre-and post-work. By removing
          homework the teachers would be able to focus their time and energy on planning effective curriculums and
          meaningful lessons. Homework also creates a learning gap between children. The variation of different parents'
          ability to help their children with their assignments is vast. The parents’ access to time, energy, money, and
          education is a question of equality that directly affects students and their study results.</p>

        <p class="py-1">It is said that Einstein came up with the relativity theory while biking and that Charles Darwin
          came up with most of the science of evolution while taking long walks. By removing time-consuming home
          studies, children would have access to more free time to perform creativity-boosting activities such as
          sports. It’s been proven that creativity comes to us when we’re physically active. Studies show that students
          performed sixty percent better during brainstorming, and remembered on average twenty percent more at vocable
          tests after taking walks around campus beforehand.</p>

        <p class="py-1">Therefore, removing homework will benefit students immensely and improve their results as well
          as their creativity. Inequality between families who can and cannot help their children at home will no longer
          be an issue. Having more free time to participate in sports and activities will lead to reduced stress and
          anxiety, boosting creativity and improving general well-being. Benefitting not only students but teachers as
          well. By having more study free time, I believe it will increase students’ curiosity during class. Education
          will therefore have a feeling of purpose and meaning, instead of a necessary evil. By removing the old school,
          kids will no longer be too cool for school.
